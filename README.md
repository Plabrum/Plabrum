# Hi, I'm Phil Labrum
I am currently a student at Harvard College stuying Computer Science on the Mind Brain Behavior track. 
This semester I am on a leave of absence, during which I am doing research for my thesis as well as working on some awesome collaborative projects.

I also run the [Quantum Computing Collaborative](quantum-computing.us) group with students at Harvard, MIT, EPFL, and UC Davis (with hopefully more to join!)

Check out [my website](plabrum.com) to see my resume and portfolio as well as some other cool projects!
