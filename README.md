# Hi
My name is Phil Labrum and I'm currently a student at Harvard College stuying Computer Science on the Mind Brain Behavior track.

I also run the [Quantum Computing Collaborative](quantum-computing.us) group with students at Harvard, MIT, EPFL and hopefully more colleges joining soon!

Check out [my website](plabrum.com) to see my resume and portfolio as well as some cool projects!
